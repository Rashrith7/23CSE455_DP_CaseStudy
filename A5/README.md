## The application

The study uses [esteham/hospital-management](https://github.com/esteham/hospital-management) at commit `1e7420e431771e3f5eec470d8a005e8255fa5fe8`. A page built with Vue 3 and Inertia sends a request to the Laravel router. The router calls a controller. The controller checks the input, calls a Laravel facade when it needs mail or a PDF, and stores the row through an Eloquent model. MySQL holds the tables.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Backend | Laravel 12, PHP ^8.2 |
| Frontend | Vue 3, Inertia |
| Database | MySQL through Eloquent |
| Inspected source | `data/code/` |
| Report | `A5_Report.pdf` |

## How a request moves

| Step | What happens | Where it is in the source |
|---|---|---|
| Patient and doctor | A patient is a `User` with a role. A doctor is a `Doctor` row linked to that user. | `data/code/app/Models/User.php`, `Doctor.php` |
| Appointment | `AppointmentController::store` checks the doctor's daily capacity, creates the `Appointment`, and sends mail. | `data/code/app/Http/Controllers/AppointmentController.php` |
| Laboratory | `DiagnosticBookingController::store` accepts cash, card, or online, sets `payment_status` to pending, and creates a `BookingDiagnostic` row. | `data/code/app/Http/Controllers/Diagnostic/DiagnosticBookingController.php` |
| Medical record | The doctor who owns the appointment writes `prescription_text`, builds a PDF, and emails it. | `data/code/app/Http/Controllers/Doctor/AppointmentController.php` |
| Package booking | A separate table stores `payment_type`, `amount_paid`, and `total_amount`. | `data/code/app/Models/PackageBooking.php` |

## Part 1 findings

| Pattern | Where it appears | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Active Record | Appointment row, diagnostic payment flags, patient and doctor identity | 3 |
| Facade | Prescription mail and PDF, and the controller imports of Auth, Mail, Validator, DB, and Pdf. These are Laravel's own facades. | 2 |

| Pattern | Result in the examined modules |
|---|---|
| Adapter | Not identified |
| Proxy | Not identified |
| Strategy | Not identified. `payment_method` is the list cash, card, online. |
| Repository | Not identified. Queries sit in the controllers. |
| Observer | Not identified. Mail is sent inside `storePrescription`. |
| Service layer | Not identified. `DiagnosticService` is the catalogue model. |

The rows, file paths, and line ranges are in `Part1/patterns.csv` and `Part1/Pattern_count.csv`. The current architecture is `Part1/pattern_architecture/current_architecture.pdf`.

## Part 2 findings

| Integration | Code in the application | Design recorded in this folder |
|---|---|---|
| Laboratory | `DiagnosticBookingController` creates `BookingDiagnostic` | `LaboratoryIntegrationService` and `LaboratoryIntegrationInterface` in `Part2/code/` |
| Billing | The controller stores `payment_method` and `payment_status` | `BillingService` and `PaymentStrategy`, with `StripePayment` and `PayPalPayment` |
| Patient data | Controllers read `User`, `Appointment`, and `Prescription` | `PatientDataService`, `EHRProvider`, `EpicEHRAdapter`, and `EpicFHIRApi` |

| Pattern | Role in the design | Where the runnable code is |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter | Turns a nested FHIR sample into first name, last name, and phone | `Part3/adapter/` |
| Strategy | Swaps Stripe and PayPal behind one payment call | `Part3/strategy/` |
| Proxy | A cache in front of the patient-record call | Recorded with Change 3 |
| Facade | The Laravel facades already in the controllers | Unchanged |

`Part2/pattern_evalution.csv` is the pattern table for this part. `Part2/diagrams/evolved_architecture.pdf`, `adapter_uml.pdf`, and `strategy_uml.pdf` are the figures. Change 1, Change 2, and Change 3 each have a requirement, a difference note, and a test result.

## Part 3 findings

| Language | Adapter command | Strategy command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Java | `javac AdapterDemo.java` then `java AdapterDemo` | `javac StrategyDemo.java` then `java StrategyDemo` | Exit 0 |
| Python | `python adapter_demo.py` | `python strategy_demo.py` | Exit 0 |
| JavaScript | `node adapterDemo.js` | `node strategyDemo.js` | Exit 0. Exit 1 if the checked fields are wrong. |
| C++ | `g++ -std=c++17 adapter_demo.cpp -o adapter_demo` | `g++ -std=c++17 strategy_demo.cpp -o strategy_demo` | Exit 0. Exit 1 if the checked fields are wrong. |

| Check | Printed result | Output file |
|---|---|---|
| Adapter, patient `PT-98765` | first name John, last name Smith, phone `555-1234` | `data/test_result/adapter_java.txt` and the Python, JavaScript, and C++ files beside it |
| Strategy, reference `DX-1001` | provider `stripe`, amount 1200, status paid | `data/test_result/strategy_java.txt` and the three files beside it |
| Strategy, reference `DX-1002` | provider `paypal`, amount 850.5, status paid | same strategy files |

The comparison tables are `Part3/adapter/pattern_crosslanguage.csv` and `Part3/strategy/pattern_crosslanguage.csv`.

Paths inside the CSV files start from this `A5/` folder. Each diagram PDF sits next to its `.tex` source. The screenshot in the report is the A5 folder.
